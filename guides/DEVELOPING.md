If you'd like to edit or develop the component locally, you can run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abhchand/vanilla-tree-viewer.git

yarn install
yarn run dev
```

This will open `http://localhost:3035` in a browser window. Any changes made to the `src/` or to the `demo/index.jsx` file will be hot reloaded.
